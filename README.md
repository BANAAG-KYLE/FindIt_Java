## Project Overview

FINDIT is a Lost and Found System designed to simplify the process of reporting, tracking, and recovering lost items. Built using Java programming techniques, the system provides a user-friendly platform that helps individuals and organizations efficiently manage lost belongings. By creating a streamlined, secure, and accessible solution, FINDIT transforms the traditional lost and found experience. The system enables easy item reporting, ownership verification, and item recovery, while supporting sustainability by reducing unnecessary item replacements and promoting community cooperation. More than just a technical tool, FINDIT represents an innovative approach to solving a common everyday challenge, making lost item management simple, transparent, and effective.

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

The system demonstrates the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming through thoughtful design and implementation:

#### 1. Abstraction
"Abstraction in our system is primarily implemented through the BaseItem abstract class and various manager classes:

```java
abstract class BaseItem {
    protected String itemId;
    protected String description;
    protected String location;
    protected LocalDate foundDate;
    
    public abstract String getItemDetails();
}
```

#### 2. Inheritance
"We've implemented inheritance to promote code reuse and establish clear hierarchies:

```java
class Item extends BaseItem implements ItemStatus, Categorizable {
    private String category;
    private boolean claimed;
    private String status;
    // Additional implementation
}
```

#### 3. Encapsulation
"Encapsulation is crucial for data security and maintenance. We've implemented it through:

```java
// Private fields
private String category;
private boolean claimed;
private String status;

// Public interface methods
public String getCategory() { return category; }
public void setCategory(String category) { this.category = category; }
public boolean isClaimed() { return claimed; }
```



#### 4. Polymorphism
"We've implemented both interface and implementation polymorphism:

```java
// Interface definitions
interface ItemStatus {
    boolean isClaimed();
    void setClaimed(boolean claimed);
    String getStatus();
}

interface Categorizable {
    String getCategory();
    void setCategory(String category);
}
```


## Sustainable Development Goals Integration

### SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
<div align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/BANAAG-KYLE/FindIt/blob/main/Images/SDG-11_banner.png" alt="SDG 11 Banner" width="800"/> </div>

FINDIT contributes to sustainable urban management by facilitating item recovery and reuse. The system reduces waste by providing an efficient mechanism for reuniting lost items with their owners, thereby minimizing unnecessary product replacements and promoting a circular economy approach.

### SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions
<div align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/BANAAG-KYLE/FindIt/blob/main/Images/SGD-16_banner.png" alt="SDG 16 Banner" width="800"/> </div>
The application supports institutional integrity through its transparent and accountable item tracking and claim processes. By implementing secure data management and providing equal access to item recovery services, FINDIT embodies principles of fairness and institutional accountability.

## 1. Report a Lost Item

<img src="https://github.com/BANAAG-KYLE/FindIt_Java/blob/main/Images/OOP_REPORT.png" alt="FINDIT Logo" width="400"/>

When you've found a lost item, use this option to officially log it in the system:
- Enter a detailed item description (minimum 3 words)
- Specify the location where the item was found
- Input the exact date of finding the item (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Select a category: Electronics, Clothing, Accessories, or Others
- The system will generate a unique Item ID for tracking

## 2. Verify Item Ownership

<img src="https://github.com/BANAAG-KYLE/FindIt_Java/blob/main/Images/OOP_VERIFY_TABLE.png" alt="FINDIT Logo" width="400"/>

This feature helps you claim your lost item securely:
- Search for your item using a descriptive search term
- Browse through matching unclaimed items displayed in a table
  
<img src="https://github.com/BANAAG-KYLE/FindIt_Java/blob/main/Images/OOP_FAILED.png" alt="FINDIT Logo" width="400"/>

- Select the item by its ID
- Provide your full name and contact information
- Describe the item in detail to prove ownership
- The system checks description similarity (60% match required)
  
<img src="https://github.com/BANAAG-KYLE/FindIt_Java/blob/main/Images/OOP_VERIFIED.png" alt="FINDIT Logo" width="400"/>
  
- If verified, you'll receive a unique claim code

## 3. Claim an Item

<img src="https://github.com/BANAAG-KYLE/FindIt_Java/blob/main/Images/OOP_CLAIM.png" alt="FINDIT Logo" width="400"/>

Use this option when you have a claim code:
- Enter the claim code generated during ownership verification
- If the code is valid, the item will be marked as claimed
- You'll receive confirmation of successful item claim

## 4. View All Items

<img src="https://github.com/BANAAG-KYLE/FindIt_Java/blob/main/Images/OOP_VIEW_ALL.png" alt="FINDIT Logo" width="400"/>

Quickly see all currently unclaimed items:
- Displays a table of items with their ID, location, found date, and category
- Helps you browse recently found items

## 5. Admin Settings

<img src="https://github.com/BANAAG-KYLE/FindIt_Java/blob/main/Images/OOP_ADMIN_MENU.png" alt="FINDIT Logo" width="400"/>

Secure administrative access with features:
- Requires admin password for entry
